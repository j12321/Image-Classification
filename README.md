# Image Classification for Geographic Scenes

## Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying geographic scene images into six distinct categories using transfer learning. The model leverages pre-trained models, including ResNet50, ResNet100, EfficientNetB0, and VGG16 to achieve high accuracy in image classification tasks.

## Dataset
* The dataset consists of images labeled into six geographic scene categories.

* Data augmentation techniques were applied to improve generalization.
