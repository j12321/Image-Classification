# Image Classification for Geographic Scenes

## Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying geographic scene images into six distinct categories using transfer learning. The model leverages pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as ResNet50 to achieve high accuracy in image classification tasks.
